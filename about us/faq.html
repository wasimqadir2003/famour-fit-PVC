			<h1> FAQ's </h1>
			<p>
				<span class="detail">

					Can anyone buy from your site, or is it strictly for professionals?<br>
					Though our prices reflect deep industry discounts, anyone is able to buy from our website. Due to our buying power with some of the top manufacturers in the industry, we can sell even orders of less than box quantity at bulk pricing. If you have an order that totals over $1000 dollars please give us a call to see if your order is eligible for further discounts.<br><br>
					Do you have an order minimum?<br>
					To better meet the needs of all our different customers, we no longer have an order minimum. We proudly supply products to a wide range of customer types, from large businesses to DIY homeowners.<br><br>
					Do you offer free shipping?<br>
					We choose to offer discounted parts as opposed to free shipping. Other stores will inflate their prices to make up for the money they lose in shipping. We prefer to simply offer the lowest prices on our products. Our pricing team is price checking items against our competitors daily to make sure our customers are getting the best deals possible.<br><br>
					Why does your product picture look different from what I've seen?<br>
					Because we carry thousands of products, each in different sizes and brands, it is difficult to show an exact picture of each and every product. That's why you may run across products that are represented by a generic photo of a similar part. This is just to give you an idea of the type of part you're buying. The part you receive may differ slightly in size, color, brand, and design. If in doubt, always refer to the part number and description. These are accurate portrayals of the part. For most plumbing and industrial applications this will not matter, as you order by part number. If, however, you are looking for a very specific shape, color, or design feature (like ridges for using a wrench) please contact us before placing your order to ensure we can supply what you need.<br><br>
					What brand is the part I'm getting?<br>
					PVC pipe and fittings are unique in that they generally have a standard part number across all manufacturers. The majority of our PVC fittings come from IPEX, Charlotte Pipe, Spears, Lasco or Georg Fischer. Keep in mind, while you may see one brand represented in the product photo, we may send you another comparable brand. We typically will send the parts that are readily available in stock or that are available in close proximity to the shipping destination. PVC Fittings Online is dedicated to offering you only the best of the best. If you would prefer a particular brand please give us a call. We try our best to accommodate brand requests. Note: Some parts are less economical from certain manufacturers. If the brand requested is more expensive, it may increase the price of the part.<br><br>
					Do you charge sales tax?<br>
					Because of our presence in South Carolina, we do charge the standard tax rate for any orders shipped to South Carolina. Internet orders that ship to any other US states are not subject to sales tax at the time an order is placed. Customers are responsible for their own sales and use tax for purchases made in states other than South Carolina. To see if you will be charged tax at checkout, plug your information into the shipping estimator on the shopping cart page and check your grand total to see if a tax line has been added.<br><br>

					*Schools and Other Tax Exempt Institutions: See above to determine if you will be charged sales tax at checkout. If your shipment is going to South Carolina and your order is legally tax exempt please call us for assistance.<br><br>
					How much will my shipping be?<br>
					PVC Fittings Online uses standard UPS and USPS rates when calculating shipping charges. To see how much shipping will be on your particular order, please add all items to your cart and put in your 'ship to' zip code as if you're checking out. A special shipping rate calculator is built into our site to calculate how much it will cost to ship your order. If you have an oversize item in your order (very few products are in this category) we will contact you after your order has been placed to arrange shipment. <br><br>
